# fillit

This is a tetris solver that uses recursion. It originially was going to not use recursion but for the sake of saving time,
and this being my first real project at 42. I decided to just finish it the way everyone else did and save the extra time for
a more interesting project.

To compile use gcc or make on any unix based system. If (windows) then use visual studio code or something similar.
